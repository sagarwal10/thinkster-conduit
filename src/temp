Hi Professor

I am sorry but I went through Module 3 and I am a little unclear. Please if you don't
mind a couple of questions: 

1. So do we do Junior Programmer 1.3 - High speed car chase for this week?
    Or more or less? I don't see a submission entry in assignments.

2. For the error message the student had, you mentioned the correction should
And the error is on line 18 -  it should be transform.Translate 

    But I'm not clear. Thats what the student had typed in. I'm not seeing it. Do you 
    mean translate (with a smaller T rather than the capitalized)? 

3. You mention continue to build the "Virtual World" - I haven't even started and I don't
where the instructions are for that? 

I feel like I am missing some part of Canvas that I don't see or have access to. 
Please help. 

thanks
shalabh
